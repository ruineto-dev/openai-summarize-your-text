# OpenAI API Summarize Your Text

This is an example of an application that receives a text and summarizes it, the example available in the OpenAI API [quick start tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) was used as a basis. It uses the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-summarize-your-text
   ```

4. Install the requirements
